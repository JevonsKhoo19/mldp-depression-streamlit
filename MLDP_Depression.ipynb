Academic pressure ranges from 0 to 5, with a median value of 3, indicating that most students experience a moderate level of academic stress. Similarly, CGPA values range from 0 to 10, with a mean of approximately 7.66, suggesting generally satisfactory academic performance among students.\n",

    "Several numerical features, such as Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction, have a median value of 0, indicating that a large proportion of students may not be engaged in formal employment. This observation suggests that work-related variables may interact differently with depression depending on whether a student is working, which may be explored further during feature engineering.\n",

    "The distribution of the target variable, Depression, was examined to understand how student records are divided between depressed and non-depressed cases. This step is important for identifying potential class imbalance, which can significantly affect model training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, 16,336 students are labelled as experiencing depression (Depression = 1), while 11,565 students are labelled as not depressed (Depression = 0). This indicates that approximately 59% of the dataset belongs to the positive (depressed) class, while 41% belongs to the negative class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the dataset is not extremely imbalanced, there is a noticeable skew toward the depressed class. This imbalance suggests that relying solely on overall accuracy may be misleading, as a model could achieve relatively high accuracy by favouring the majority class. As a result, evaluation metrics that account for class-level performance, such as F1-score, are more appropriate for this classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the distribution of the target variable informs later modelling decisions, including metric selection, model comparison, and interpretation of results. In the context of mental health prediction, it is particularly important to evaluate how well the model identifies depressed individuals, as misclassifying such cases may have more serious real-world implications."

In addition to statistical measures for numerical variables, this output provides information on the number of unique values, the most frequent categories, and their frequencies for categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, several categorical features exhibit a relatively small number of unique values. For example, Gender contains two categories, while Sleep Duration has five categories and Dietary Habits has four categories. These low-cardinality features are well suited for one-hot encoding and are unlikely to introduce excessive dimensionality during preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other categorical variables, such as City (52 unique values), Profession (14 unique values), and Degree (28 unique values), have higher cardinality. While these features may contain useful contextual information, their larger number of categories suggests that careful encoding and feature management will be required to avoid unnecessary feature explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent categories provide insight into dominant patterns within the dataset. For instance, the most common profession is Student, and the most frequent sleep duration category is “Less than 5 hours”, which may indicate widespread sleep deprivation among students. Additionally, a majority of students report having had suicidal thoughts (Yes), highlighting the severity of mental health concerns represented in the dataset.\n",

    "The Financial Stress feature shows multiple categorical levels, with the highest stress level appearing most frequently. This suggests that financial pressure is a common experience among students and may be an important contributor to depression.\n",

    "Overall, this summary confirms that the dataset contains a mixture of low- and high-cardinality categorical features, along with several meaningful numerical variables. These observations justify the use of categorical encoding techniques, motivate later feature engineering to reduce complexity, and support the inclusion of psychosocial factors in the predictive modelling process."

    "The count plot illustrates the distribution of depression status across gender categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, both male and female students show a higher number of depressed cases (Depression = 1) compared to non-depressed cases (Depression = 0). However, the absolute number of depressed students is higher among males than females. This pattern is influenced in part by the dataset composition, as male students form a larger proportion of the dataset overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this difference in absolute counts, depression is present in both gender groups, suggesting that gender alone is unlikely to be a sufficient predictor of depression. Instead, gender may interact with other factors such as academic pressure, lifestyle habits, or financial stress to influence mental health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation indicates that while Gender may contribute some predictive value, it should be considered alongside other features rather than treated as a dominant standalone factor. As such, gender is retained as an input feature during modelling but is not expected to be the primary driver of depression predictions."

    "This plot examines the relationship between sleep duration and depression status among students.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, students who report sleeping less than 5 hours per day show a noticeably higher number of depressed cases compared to non-depressed cases. A similar, though slightly less pronounced, pattern is observed among students sleeping 5–6 hours. This suggests that insufficient sleep may be associated with higher levels of depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, students who report sleeping 7–8 hours or more than 8 hours show a more balanced distribution between depressed and non-depressed cases, indicating that adequate sleep duration may be linked to better mental health outcomes. The “Others” category contains very few observations and therefore provides limited interpretative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations align with existing research linking sleep deprivation to increased risk of mental health issues. As such, Sleep Duration appears to be a meaningful feature for predicting depression and is retained for model training. This variable may also interact with academic pressure and workload, further motivating its inclusion in the modelling process."

    "\n",
    "From the plot, the median age of depressed students appears to be slightly lower than that of non-depressed students. The interquartile range for the depressed group is also narrower, indicating that depressed cases are more concentrated within a younger age range. This suggests that younger students in the dataset may be more vulnerable to depression compared to older students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both groups contain several outliers, particularly at higher ages, indicating that depression is not limited to a specific age group. However, the substantial overlap between the two distributions suggests that age alone is unlikely to be a strong predictor of depression.\n",

    "These observations imply that while Age may contribute some predictive information, it should be considered alongside other academic, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors during model training rather than as a dominant standalone feature."

Logistic Regression is a widely used linear classification algorithm that is well suited for binary classification tasks and provides a strong, interpretable baseline for comparison with more complex models.\n",

    "The baseline model was trained using the default configuration provided by scikit-learn, with a few practical settings applied. The model uses L2 regularisation (penalty='l2') to prevent overfitting by discouraging excessively large coefficients. The regularisation strength is controlled by the parameter C = 1.0, which represents a balanced trade-off between model complexity and generalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lbfgs solver was used, which is appropriate for small- to medium-sized datasets and supports L2 regularisation efficiently. The maximum number of iterations was increased to 1000 to ensure convergence during training. A fixed random_state was specified to make the results reproducible.\n",

This is especially important for a screening-style task because low Recall(1) would mean more **false negatives** (missing true depression cases). **Accuracy** is also reported as a secondary metric to show overall correctness across both classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "After selecting Logistic Regression as the baseline/primary model, I generated a **coefficient importance table** to understand which encoded features the model relies on most strongly. Logistic Regression produces a coefficient for every input column after one-hot encoding. A larger absolute coefficient, means that feature has a stronger influence on the model’s decision boundary, making it a useful interpretability method for explaining model behaviour and motivating later Feature Selection (FS) and Feature Engineering (FE).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key findings from ranked coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "From the ranked output, the strongest driver by far is **'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?_Yes'** with a coefficient of **+2.517**. This indicates that, in this dataset pattern, this response has the most powerful association with predicting **Class 1 (Depression = 1)** compared to many other inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next most influential feature is **'Profession_Student'** with coefficient **−1.671**, which strongly pushes predictions away from Class 1. However, this is important to interpret correctly: because one-hot encoding used `drop_first=True`, coefficients are **relative to the reference category** (the dropped profession). This means the sign does not indicate a universal truth about 'students', but rather how 'student' compares to whichever profession category was dropped as the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other notable high-impact features\n",
    "\n",
    "Other notable high-impact features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dietary Habits_Unhealthy** (+1.092)  \n",
    "- **Academic Pressure** (+0.838)  \n",
    "- **Job Satisfaction** (+0.569)  \n",
    "- **Financial Stress** (+0.546)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The table also shows several **City_* columns** appearing among the influential features (e.g. **City_Nalyan** −0.476, **City_Kibara** −0.458), which is important because City is a high-cardinality variable, it expands into many one-hot columns and can create location-specific patterns that may not generalise well.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this table serves as evidence of what the model actually learns, which helps justify later FS/FE experiments (e.g. testing the impact of dropping City or dropping sensitive survey fields).\n"

    "## Coefficient Interpretation (Top + / Top − Drivers)\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the interpretation clearer, I split the coefficients into the **top risk-increasing drivers** (largest positive coefficients) and **top risk-decreasing drivers** (most negative coefficients). This improves explainability because the model’s output for **Class 1** is based on a weighted sum of these inputs: **positive coefficients** increase the model’s score towards Class 1, while **negative coefficients** reduce it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-increasing (towards Depression = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest positive driver remains **'Have you ever had suicidal thoughts ?_Yes'** (**+2.517**), followed by **Dietary Habits_Unhealthy** (**+1.092**) and **Academic Pressure** (**+0.838**). This suggests that lifestyle and pressure-related variables provide meaningful signal in the dataset, which supports why later Feature Engineering focuses on combining or refining pressure-related features (e.g. **Total_Pressure**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Several categorical categories such as **Degree_Others** (**+0.808**) and **Profession_Architect** (**+0.671**) also appear, but these should be interpreted carefully because they are **relative to the dropped reference categories** (due to one-hot encoding with `drop_first=True`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-decreasing (away from Depression = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest negative coefficient is **Profession_Student** (**−1.671**). After that, multiple **City** categories appear (e.g. **City_Nalyan** **−0.476**, **City_Kibara** **−0.458**, **City_Nagpur** **−0.362**). This reinforces an important modelling observation, the model may be learning **location-linked patterns** that could be noise or dataset-specific rather than stable signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly why an FS experiment like **dropping City** is reasonable, it tests whether performance stays stable while removing potentially non-generalisable, high-cardinality features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this 'top + / top −' breakdown is useful because it converts a long coefficient table into a human-readable explanation, it shows which factors push predictions higher, which push them lower, and it creates a clear bridge into FS/FE justification (what to keep, what to simplify, what might be risky to rely on).\n"

    "For FS1, I ran a feature-selection variant where I removed the City column entirely before encoding and model training. The motivation is that City is a high-cardinality categorical feature (many unique values), which expands into many one-hot encoded columns. This can increase sparsity and model complexity, and in some cases encourages the model to learn location-specific patterns that may not generalise well. From a deployment perspective, removing City also improves practicality because the user does not need to provide a location, and it reduces the chance of the model relying on proxy signals that could be indirectly sensitive.\n",

They also add deployment friction: a real user may not want to disclose job/education details, and these two columns increase one-hot encoded dimensionality. By dropping them, the model becomes simpler, the UI becomes easier to fill in, and the system depends more on behavioural/lifestyle/stress indicators (e.g. pressure, satisfaction, sleep, financial stress), which aligns better with the app’s educational purpose.\n",

In other words, dropping Profession and Degree does not meaningfully reduce the model’s ability to detect Class 1, while slightly improving overall balance and simplifying the feature space.\n",

    "For FS4, I tested a more aggressive feature selection variant by removing CGPA, Degree, and City together before training. The purpose was to check whether the model can still perform well without (1) academic performance information (CGPA), (2) education background information (Degree), and (3) location information (City). These three features can also be “proxy-like” in real life (e.g., reflecting access to resources, socioeconomic factors, or environment), and they add deployment friction—especially City, which is high-cardinality and expands into many one-hot columns. Dropping them makes the model simpler, reduces one-hot dimensionality, and makes the Streamlit form easier and less sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "After retraining with the same pipeline and evaluating on the same test split (X_test / y_test), performance was slightly lower than baseline but still strong overall:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: 0.8479 (Baseline: 0.8488, −0.0009)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall (Class 1): 0.8860 (Baseline: 0.8905, −0.0044)\n",
    "\n",
    "F1: 0.8692 (Baseline: 0.8704, −0.0012)\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that these three removed features contain some predictive signal, but not enough to cause a large collapse in performance. The model still maintains a high Class 1 recall (~0.89), meaning it continues to capture most positive cases in the dataset pattern—important for a recall-first screening-style objective. At the same time, the class-wise report remains similar to baseline, suggesting the model’s overall behaviour did not drastically change; it still trades off some Class 0 recall to keep Class 1 recall high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: FS4 shows that the model can remain robust even after dropping multiple “profile/proxy-heavy” attributes (CGPA, Degree, City). However, compared to simpler drops like removing only City, FS4 slightly reduces recall and F1. Therefore, FS4 is useful as an exploration of “privacy-friendly simplification,” but it is not the best-performing feature selection configuration relative to baseline and other variants."

Therefore, when comparing FS/FE variants, I focused on whether Recall(1) is preserved or improved, while also checking F1 for overall balance and ensuring the final pipeline stays deployable in Streamlit.\n",

This also reduces redundancy and makes the model easier to explain in the app because the prediction can be linked to a clearer concept (“total pressure”) rather than two separate values.\n",

The key objective of this project is to identify depression cases (Class 1), so Recall(1) is prioritised because it measures how many true positive cases are successfully detected (reducing false negatives).\n",

    "\n",
    "## What I tuned and why\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression performance is heavily influenced by its regularisation settings, which control how strongly the model penalises large coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code><b>C</b></code> controls regularisation strength (smaller C → stronger regularisation).\n",
    "- <code><b>Penalty</b></code> (l1 vs l2) changes the regularisation type:\n",
    "  - <code>l1</code> can push some coefficients to zero (more “feature selection” behaviour).\n",
    "  - <code>l2</code> shrinks coefficients smoothly and is typically more stable.\n",

    "\n",
